Simple CRUD project for DBMS practical
------------------------------------------
Hostel Entry System is a very simple CRUD project built in order to understand common database operations using PHP + MySQL. It contains basic Session operation for login and other purposes. Letâ€™s first understand what we are building before actually jumping into the code part.
## The basic workflow:
    1. The admin logs into the system.
    2. The admin can view all students.
    3. The admin can make a new entry.
    4. The admin can edit existing entry.
    5. The admin can delete entry.
    6. The admin logs out after performing required operation.
    
## The coding part:
1. If you are looking to use it as starter template:
    Simply clone the repo, change database config in config/db.php and make changes however you like.
2. If you are a learner: 
    The step by step coding with explanation is present [HERE](https://ioecapsule.com/hostel-entry-system-simple-crud-project-for-dbms-using-php-mysql/). The article and this repo corresponds the same project. So, its worth reading than going through code directly.
